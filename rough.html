  <h4>D. Core Values</h4>
  <p>
    This School is dedicated to the training of children in programs of study, activity, and a lifestyle
    that is Bible-centered. Students are trained to adhere to the School’s philosophy and Biblical-based
    programs. We believe that “all things should be done decently and in order” and that our learners
    should be taught to accept responsibility to “walk honorably before all men.”

  <p>
    Our bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit; therefore, we train and educate all our students to
    abstain from anything and everything that could destroy their lives as viewed from a Biblical point.
    We pray that with innovative learning tools and strategies, our students will come out on top.
